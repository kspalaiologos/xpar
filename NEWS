v0.5 (17-10-2024)
- OpenMP support for sharded mode (which unfortunately seems bottlenecked by
  I/O). 
- Switch to yarg for command-line parsing, remove dependency on Rich Felker's
  `getopt_long`.
- Hopefully the last v0.x release. Hopefully, it will receive some feedback
  which will help to introduce future improvements and release v1.0. The file
  format will not change from now on, unless there is a bug or another major
  misfeature that needs to be fixed.

===============================================================================
v0.4 (16-10-2024)
